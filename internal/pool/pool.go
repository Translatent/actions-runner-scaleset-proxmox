// Package pool owns the lifecycle of every Proxmox VM the orchestrator
// manages.
//
// The pool exists in three tiers:
//   - Hot: VMs that are fully booted, idle, and waiting to receive a JIT
//     runner config (sub-10s job start).
//   - Warm: VMs that have been cloned from the template but are powered
//     off. Promoting one to Hot costs only the boot time (~20-30s).
//   - Cold: VMs that don't yet exist. When the hot and warm pools are
//     exhausted, the reconcile loop clones-on-demand into the hot pool.
//
// State is authoritative in the in-memory store (hashicorp/go-memdb);
// Proxmox tags are used at startup to find this orchestrator's VMs and
// rebuild the empty in-memory view. Every state transition is a single
// atomic CAS via the store's write transaction.
//
// The reconcile goroutine is the single owner of the pool. It wakes on a
// ticker and on buffered-channel refill signals; Acquire is the only entry
// point for callers wanting a Hot VM.

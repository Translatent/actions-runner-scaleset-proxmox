# actions-runner-scaleset-proxmox

> Ephemeral, single-use GitHub Actions self-hosted runners backed by Proxmox VMs.

A Go service that orchestrates GitHub Actions self-hosted runners as ephemeral Proxmox VMs. Each job runs in a fresh single-use VM that is destroyed after the job completes. Hot and warm pools keep job start times low; both single-node and clustered Proxmox topologies are supported.

## Status

Pre-1.0, in active development.

## How it works

The service implements the [`actions/scaleset`](https://github.com/actions/scaleset) `Scaler` interface and long-polls GitHub for runner-demand signals. When a runner is needed it either (a) takes a fully-booted VM from the **hot pool**, (b) starts a pre-cloned VM from the **warm pool**, or (c) clones a new one from the template VMID. The JIT runner configuration is injected via the QEMU guest agent (no SSH required) and a systemd path-unit inside the VM picks it up and starts the runner. When the job finishes the runner unit's `ExecStopPost=poweroff` shuts the VM down; the orchestrator's power-state poller observes that and queues destruction.

The scaler-side Actions admin client is refreshable independently of the active listener session. If `generatejitconfig` returns HTTP 401, the scaler compare-and-refreshes the exact failed client pointer so concurrent stale requests converge on one replacement, then retries the identical JIT request once. No other HTTP status is retried by this mechanism. A failed refresh or retry releases the VM for normal demand reconciliation; the listener session and its cursor remain intact. `scaleset_jit_token_refresh_total{scaleset,outcome}` exports the bounded `success` and `failure` outcomes, while the original 401 remains visible in `scaleset_github_api_errors_total{endpoint="generate_jit"}`.

A second control loop — the **GitHub REST reconciler** — periodically lists the runners API and joins the result against the local DB. It is the backstop for the listener occasionally dropping `JobStarted` / `JobCompleted` callbacks or delivering them with empty fields: rows stuck in `assigned` past `assigned_grace`, `running` rows whose runner went idle past `running_idle_grace`, and runners that registered then went offline are all force-destroyed. It also sweeps Proxmox for VMs that carry our owner tags but have no matching DB row (with `orphan_grace` to avoid racing the boot pipeline), and removes orphan GitHub runner registrations whose VM is gone.

State lives in-process in [hashicorp/go-memdb](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-memdb) — no on-disk DB, no migrations. On startup the orchestrator reconciles its empty view against Proxmox by listing VMs tagged as owned by this scale set; any leftovers from a previous process are destroyed.

The leader also runs a fail-closed orphan-disk sweep. It considers only image
volumes whose VMID is inside a currently configured scale-set range, has no
QEMU or LXC config anywhere in the cluster, has no replication job, and has
been continuously observed for at least `pool.disk_reaper_min_age` (one hour by
default). The observations can be persisted with
`pool.disk_reaper_state_file`, which is important for ZFS because PVE does not
expose image-volume creation time through its content API. Every deletion is
revalidated immediately before the storage call. To inspect the same decision
set without deleting, run:

`pool.disk_reaper_preserve_initial` retains the eligible set present when a
new state file is initialized. This creates an explicit review boundary for
old residue while disks first observed after initialization remain automatic.

```sh
scaleset reap-orphan-disks --config /etc/scaleset/config.yaml --dry-run
```

Proxmox node placement is pluggable via `nodes.strategy`: **`single`** (always the same node, for single-node PVE), **`round_robin`** (rotate through a configured member list), or **`least_loaded`** (periodically polls `/cluster/resources` and picks the node with the lowest weighted CPU + memory load).

An optional `nodes.affinity:` block layers profile-keyed rules over the chosen strategy: pin a profile to specific nodes with `prefer_nodes: [...]` (combine with `require: true` for a hard pin that fails the clone when no preferred node is eligible), and keep two profiles off the same node with `anti_affinity_with: { profile: ... }`. Rules apply before the underlying strategy picks among the surviving candidates so rotation / load balancing keep their semantics within the eligible set. Hard-pin failures surface as `nodeselector.ErrAffinityRequireUnsatisfiable`. Config validation rejects rules that name an undeclared profile or node — typos surface at load time rather than as silent no-ops at runtime.

## Multi-scaleset schema

The config now accepts a top-level `scalesets:` list — one entry per scale set, each carrying its own `name`, `labels`, `max_concurrent_runners`, GitHub `scope:` (org/repo), `vmid_range`, and per-scaleset `profiles:` (issue #1). The legacy singular form (`scaleset:` + top-level `profiles:` + `github.scope`) is automatically normalised into a 1-element `scalesets:` list at load time, so existing configs keep working unchanged. Mixing the two shapes is rejected at load with a clear error pointing at the offending legacy keys. With more than one scaleset declared, every entry MUST carry its own `vmid_range` and the ranges must be pairwise disjoint — each scaleset's pool manager runs an independent VMID allocator, so sharing one range would race on Proxmox clone (issue #222).

Every per-scaleset Prometheus metric now carries `scaleset=<name>` as its first label so dashboards can slice cleanly. Admin endpoints are also reachable under `/admin/{scaleset}/...` (e.g. `/admin/{scaleset}/state`, `/admin/{scaleset}/preempt/{vmid}`, `/admin/{scaleset}/template/promote/{profile}`); the un-namespaced `/admin/...` paths keep working for backwards compatibility when there is exactly one scale set.

**Runtime fan-out:** under leader election, each declared scale set runs its own per-scaleset pool manager, scaler, listener, GitHub REST reconciler, canary controller, schedule runner, store, and provisioner (with its own owner-tagged crash recovery). The per-scaleset workers are spawned under a single supervisor errgroup: a panic or returned error in one worker is recovered and logged but does NOT propagate to its siblings, so one failing scale set never poisons the others. Sibling shutdown only happens via process-wide ctx cancel (SIGTERM, admin drain, leader deposal). Readiness is leader-aware AND per-scaleset: `/readyz` only flips green when every registered scale set has signaled both listener-connected and recovery-done; one stalled scale set is enough to hold the gate red.

## Runner profiles

A scale set can declare one or more **profiles** — named bundles of `{labels, template VMID, CPU / memory / disk shape, hot/warm/max sizing}`. Each profile gets its own reconcile loop and pool state; VMs are tagged with their profile name so crash recovery routes them back into the right pool on restart. Configs without a `profiles:` block keep working unchanged — the orchestrator synthesises a single `default` profile from the global `pool:` / `scaleset:` blocks. See `profiles:` in [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) for the full schema. Prometheus metrics are partitioned by `profile=` so dashboards can slice by hardware shape.

Job-to-profile routing is _best-match by labels_: a profile satisfies a job when its labels are a superset of the job's `RequestLabels`, and the profile with the smallest extra-label count wins (ties resolve by declaration order). When no profile satisfies a job, `scaleset_unrouted_jobs_total{labels="..."}` increments so operators can spot the coverage gap. Config validation rejects scale sets whose declared labels aren't collectively covered by some profile — that misconfiguration is caught at load time rather than per-job at runtime.

Each profile can declare its own `network:` block to override `proxmox.network` defaults — useful for putting GPU runners on VLAN 30, untrusted-PR runners on VLAN 99, or build-cache runners on a separate storage VLAN. Multi-NIC setups are supported via `extra_nics: [...]`. An optional `ipam:` selector picks the IP allocator: `noop` (default; DHCP via Proxmox cloud-init) or `static` (in-memory pool fed by `ipam.pool: [...]`). External IPAM backends (NetBox, Infoblox, phpIPAM, etc.) plug in behind the same `ipam.Allocator` interface — none ship in-tree yet because they need a live IPAM to verify. The pool manager calls `Allocate` before each clone and `Release` on destroy so allocations don't leak across recycles.

## Scheduled pool sizes

Each profile can declare a list of cron-driven hot/warm size overrides under `schedules:` so steady-state capacity tracks demand (e.g. `hot=10 warm=20` during business hours, `hot=0 warm=2` overnight). Each entry has a `cron` expression (standard 5-field robfig/cron syntax + `@hourly`/`@daily`/etc.), a `duration` for how long the override stays active after each fire, an optional `timezone` (IANA name; defaults to UTC), and explicit `hot_size`/`warm_size`. Overlapping schedules resolve as **last-fired wins** — when two windows are simultaneously open, the one whose cron tick was more recent applies. On startup the runner replays each schedule's most recent past fire so restarting at 02:00 inside a "midnight + 8h" window re-applies the night override instead of briefly snapping back to the profile baseline. When a window closes with no other override active, the reconcile loop reverts to the profile's configured `hot_size`/`warm_size`. Sizes are clamped to `max_concurrent_runners` (hot trimmed last). Fires increment `scaleset_schedule_fires_total{profile, schedule}`; the currently-active override is exposed as `scaleset_schedule_active{profile, schedule}` (`schedule=""` represents baseline).

## Template canary rollouts

Each profile can stage a new template image via `canary_template_vmid` + `canary_percent`: ~N% of new clones use the candidate template, the rest stay on the stable `template_vmid`. The dice is deterministic (hash of the allocated VMID), so retries of the same VMID always pick the same template — the orchestrator never accidentally rolls back to stable mid-clone. Boot failures on canary VMs feed a cumulative failure-rate counter; once the rate exceeds `canary_max_failure_rate` (with at least a small statistical sample) the orchestrator auto-reverts `canary_percent` to 0 in-process and increments `scaleset_canary_reverted_total{profile}`. Operators investigate before re-enabling. When confident in the candidate, `POST /admin/template/promote/{profile}` atomically swaps it into the stable slot. Both the auto-revert and the promotion are **in-process only** — to persist across a restart, also update `template_vmid` in the YAML.

## Multi-tenancy: quotas + priority

Optional `quotas:` and `priority:` blocks cap concurrent VMs per org or per repo, and classify jobs into priority lanes for visibility. Both are **observational today** — the `actions/scaleset` listener interface surfaces per-job metadata (`OwnerName`, `RepositoryName`, `RequestLabels`, `JobWorkflowRef`) only AFTER GitHub has paired a job with a VM, so at-acquire-time admission control needs a deeper listener-integration extension (deferred to a future PR). What ships today:

- **Stamping**: when `JobStarted` fires the scaler records the job's `Org`/`Repo`/`PriorityClass` on the VM row.
- **Counters**: `scaleset_quota_throttled_total{scope, name}` fires when a stamped row pushes its (org or repo) bucket past the configured cap; `scaleset_priority_acquires_total{class}` partitions every JobStarted by its class.
- **Manual preempt**: `POST /admin/preempt/{vmid}` destroys an Assigned-but-not-yet-Running VM via the pool's safety-gated `Preempt` API. Running VMs are refused (HTTP 409) — preempting an actively-executing job is the destructive behaviour the orchestrator explicitly promises never to do. `scaleset_preemptions_total{from_class, to_class}` records each successful preempt.

See `quotas:` and `priority:` in [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) for the YAML surface.

## Ownership and destructive-action safety

VMID range membership is defense in depth, not proof that a VM belongs to this
scaler. Every stop/delete/purge path first reads the current Proxmox VM and
requires this scale set's live owner tag. The only exemption is a VM whose
`qmclone` task completed successfully and whose VMID remains precisely tracked
while owner-tag application is pending; a clone collision never receives that
exemption.

If the live identity does not match, the scaler performs no lifecycle action,
abandons the stale in-memory row, logs the VMID/node/name/tags, and quarantines
the VMID from allocation for the rest of the process lifetime. Transient rows
are likewise abandoned and quarantined once they reach
`pool.stuck_row_max_age` (default `30m`) instead of being retried forever.

## Observability

`observability.http_addr` exposes `/metrics` (Prometheus), `/healthz`, and `/readyz` on every replica. Readiness is leader-aware: standbys are ready as long as Proxmox is reachable within the staleness window (so they can take over); leaders additionally require the scaleset listener to have connected and crash-recovery to have completed.

OTLP/HTTP tracing is opt-in via `observability.tracing.endpoint`. When empty, instrumented code paths use the no-op tracer and pay zero overhead. `sample_ratio` accepts `[0.0, 1.0]`.

## Admin API

Optional escape-hatch HTTP API enabled by setting `admin_api.http_addr` and supplying the bearer secret via the `SCALESET_ADMIN_API_SHARED_SECRET` env var. Every endpoint requires `Authorization: Bearer <shared-secret>`; failed auth attempts are rate-limited per source IP.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/admin/state` | Current pool stats (counts per lifecycle state) |
| `POST` | `/admin/drain` | Trigger a graceful drain (bounded by `pool.drain_timeout`) |
| `POST` | `/admin/preempt/{vmid}` | Preempt an Assigned VM (refuses Running; 409 when not preempt-eligible) |
| `POST` | `/admin/template/promote/{profile}` | Atomically swap a profile's canary candidate template into stable (409 when no candidate; 503 during leader transition) |
| `POST` | `/admin/destroy/{vmid}` | Force-destroy a specific VM regardless of its state |

Each non-drain endpoint also accepts a `/admin/{scaleset_name}/...` prefix (issue #1) so operators running multiple scale sets in one orchestrator can disambiguate. Unknown scaleset names return 404; the un-prefixed paths above route to the single configured scale set.

In Kubernetes multi-replica deployments the admin API is bound on every replica. Non-leader replicas reverse-proxy requests to the leader (whose endpoint is published in a Lease annotation), so callers don't need to know which pod holds the lease.

## Deployment modes

The same binary supports both single-process and Kubernetes multi-replica deployments. The mode is selected by `cluster.mode` in `config.yaml`:

- **`standalone`** (default) — the process is always leader. Used for the Docker image at [deploy/docker/Dockerfile](deploy/docker/Dockerfile) and the systemd unit at [deploy/systemd/scaleset.service](deploy/systemd/scaleset.service).
- **`kubernetes`** — N replicas elect a leader via a `coordination.k8s.io/v1` Lease (`k8s.io/client-go/tools/leaderelection`). Only the leader runs the control plane (GitHub scaleset listener, REST reconciler, pool manager + Proxmox power-state poller); standbys serve only `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics` until promoted. The admin API is bound on every replica and reverse-proxies to the leader (whose endpoint is published in a Lease annotation), so the design is safe to deploy through Flux/Argo CD — the controller only writes to the Lease it created.

A Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment lives in [deploy/chart/](deploy/chart/).

## Releases

[`deploy/chart/Chart.yaml`](deploy/chart/Chart.yaml) is the single release
version source: `version` and `appVersion` must contain the same
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` value. A push to `main` creates the corresponding `v` tag
and GitHub Release directly when that version is new; an existing release is a
successful no-op.

## Development

| --- | --- |
| `task test` | Unit tests, race-enabled, no build tags |
| `task e2e` | In-process e2e suite against fake Proxmox + fake GitHub (no external deps; ~30s) |
| `task e2e-packer` | `packer validate -syntax-only` on the HCL (skips if Packer not installed) |
